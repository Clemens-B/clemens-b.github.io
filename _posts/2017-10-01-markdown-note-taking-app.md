title: Markdown Note Taking App for Desktop
teaser: There are a lot of Note Apps out there. But none of them works with raw markdown files and a folder structure to categorize and organize your notes. So I build my own one based on Electron and Angular.
category: desktop
tags: [electron, angular2+, typescript]

# Markdown Note Taking App for Desktop
build with [marked.js](https://github.com/chjj/marked), [ace editor](https://ace.c9.io/) and [prism.js](http://prismjs.com/) based on [Maxime's boilerplate](https://github.com/maximegris/angular-electron)

## Description
MyNotes.md is a markdown note taking app, which takes a lokal directory with markdown files, so you can edit them in an nice and easy way without opening a new instance of your IDE.
