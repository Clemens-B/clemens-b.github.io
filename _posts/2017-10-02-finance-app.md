title: Finance App for Desktop
teaser: My girlfriend an I share the bill for grocery shopping and similar things. At the end of the month we sum it all up and divide it by two. My girlfriend does this in an ugly spreadsheet. Of course I can do it better. So I build a desktop app themed with pengiuns (my girlfriend loves them). ðŸ˜ƒ

# Finance App for Sharing Bills 
PinguFibu is an electron app, which works completly offline. There are no data stored in the cloud or on the internet. This was mandatory but makes the app only useable on one device. The electron files are bundle to one executeble file (.exe) and the application is integrated into the windows start menu.

The app is using Angular4 and I experimented a little bit with page transition, which is a really nice feature.

## Description
You can create an accounting period and enter the invoices of the grocery stores. At the end you can see who as to pay who. You can share an accounting period via Hangouts and mark them as paid.
