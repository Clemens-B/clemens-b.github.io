title: Progressive Web App for Watched Series
teaser: You can watch your favourite series on a TV, Laptop, Tablet or even your Smartphone. But there is no central way of managing your watched series and episodes. You either have to chose a mobile app or a website to track your progress. So we build a progressive web app which can do both.
